# Face-Recognition-System

1.This Project on Face Recognition System uses haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml which is a pretrained file on detecting the face part which made the task to recognise the face easy 
because this file is used to extract the face part from the image or from the video stream .

2.In this project KNN(K Nearest Neighbors) Algorithm is implemented which is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to identify the class to which the testing point belongs.

3.This prject is implemented using Python programming language because Python provides various libraries which helps in creating projects especialy for machine learning Python is 
the best.
